This project is an inventory tracking application.

It preforms 3 major tasks

	1) Allows the user to manage and update an inventory of all the components that go in the GX-5 and GX-35 system
	2) Allows the user to organize the components into individual kits for a system.  
	3) Once a kit is manufactured into a system, the user can keep track of the status and possibly the QC data for that system
